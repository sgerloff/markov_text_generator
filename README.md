# markov_text_generator
This is a basic markov chain generator that I have implemented for practice. It reads the corpus of text from nltk's gutenberg and generates a random sentence.

## Basic usage:
```bash
$ python main.py
>>> "Without losing any time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then had suffered for one hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury."
```
Executing the main script will print a sentence generated by the markov chain, where the state size is three words.
